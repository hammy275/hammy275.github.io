# Inter-Mod Compatibility

ImmersiveMC supports many mods, with the list of supported mods and blocks from them constantly expanding! 

## Automatically Supported Mods

Some mods are supported automatically by ImmersiveMC, such as the crafting table Immersive supporting most modded crafting tables without any additional code from ImmersiveMC. The number of mods that would be listed here is likely countless, and won't be listed, but you should try mods that have blocks that are variants of blocks from the base-game, they will likely work!

## Manually Supported Mods

ImmersiveMC also has code to add support to some mods. Note that not all mods below are supported across all Minecraft versions by ImmersiveMC.

- Furnaces from **Iron Furnaces**.
- The salvaging table and modified enchanting table from **Apotheosis** (and **Zenith**).
- Chests, barrels, and shulker boxes from **Lootr**.
- The crafting station from **Tinkers Construct**.
- The modified crafting table from **Visual Workbench**.

While using an Immersive integrating with one of these mods, you may see a message in chat along the lines of `"ImmersiveMC compatibility for {MOD_NAME} has encountered an error, so it has been disabled. Please report this error in the ImmersiveMC Discord server or on ImmersiveMC's GitHub"`. If you see this message, there is either a bug with ImmersiveMC's integration with the mod, or the mod has been updated in such a way where ImmersiveMC compatibility breaks. In either case, **this is not the fault of the mod author**, but **is the fault of ImmersiveMC**. If you see this message, please report the issue to ImmersiveMC's Discord server or GitHub issues page, as the message states, so the issue can be fixed.
