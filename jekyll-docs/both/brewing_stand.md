# Brewing Stand

To use the brewing immersive, there are five slots, the middle-left slot, the middle slot, and the three slots on the bottom "row". You can place/right click blaze powder into the middle-left slot, place/right click potion ingredients into the middle slot, and you can place water bottles or other potions into the bottom slots.
