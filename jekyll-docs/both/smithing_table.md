# Smithing Table

Place your template in the left blue box, your tool, armor, or other "main" item in the middle blue box, and your material in the right blue box, by right-clicking/physically placing the item. An item should then appear above the smithing table if the three items you placed would create something (a netherite template + a diamond sword + a netherite ingot would create a netherite sword, for example). Simply right-click the item, or place your hand inside the item and press your "break block" button in VR, and you'll grab the item!
