# Beacon

The beacon immersive allows one to set a beacon without opening the UI!

When hovering over a beacon, you can choose between any available potions effects on your left. On your right, if your beacon is tier 4, you can choose whether to also apply regeneration (the heart symbol) or to make the effect level two (the plus symbol).

The beacon block contains a slot to place in a payment item. Once a payment item is in and the settings are valid, a checkmark will appear above the payment. Interact with that, are you're good to go!

P.S. The majority of the beacon interactions will require one to press the trigger if they are in VR!
