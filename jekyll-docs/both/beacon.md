# Beacon

The beacon immersive allows one to set a beacon without opening the UI!

When hovering over a beacon, you can choose between any available potions effects on your left. On your right, if your beacon is tier 4, you can choose whether to also apply regeneration (the heart symbol) or to amplify the effect (the plus symbol).

The beacon block contains a slot to place in a payment item at the bottom of the block itself.

## Non-VR

Once you've inserted a payment, selected an effect, and selected the regeneration or amplify option, a checkmark will appear. Once interacted with, the beacon's new effects will take place! Note that if you're in VR and using this mode, you'll need to press your break block button to interact with most things.

## VR

While in VR, you should insert your payment first. From there, grab your effect in one hand, and if your beacon is tier four, grab the regeneration or amplification in your other hand. Once that's all done, place the hands holding things into the beacon, and the new effects will take place!

If you want to use the non-VR version of the beacon, simply disable "Use Grab Beacon [VR Only]" in ImmersiveMC's settings.
