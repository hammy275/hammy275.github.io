# Crafting Table

## Non-VR

Using the crafting table immersive is simple! Simply right click on the blue boxes above the crafting table, placing items in the same way you would your 3x3 crafting grid. From there, you can right click the floating item that appears above the crafting table to retrieve whatever you wanted to craft! If you have any items in the table that you want to take, just right-click them with an empty hand!

## VR

Using the crafting table immersive is simple! Simply place the items into the blue boxes by placing your hand in said blue boxes. Place the items in the same pattern you would for the standard crafting grid. From there, move your hand into the item that appears above the crafting table, and press the trigger (or whatever button you have mapped to "attack") to craft that item! If you have any items in the table that you want to take, just grab them with an empty hand!
