# Chest

Chests, trapped chests, and ender chests can all be interacted with!

## Opening/Closing the Chest

By default, you can only interact with chests in VR. Move your hands at the line around two-thirds up the front of the chest, then make them rise quickly, as if you're trying to flip the lid of the chest open. To close the chest, brings your arms up to be level with the top of the lid, then move your arms down, as if you were closing the lid (even if you aren't touching it)!

**If you want to use the chest outside of VR**, turn on the setting `Right Click Chests`. Once you do so, you'll be able to open/close the chest from outside of VR with a right click, and inside of VR by pressing whatever button you have mapped to "Use" (the button used to place blocks).

## Using the Chest

Once you have the chest open, you can right click/grab items or blue boxes to place items in/take items out of the chest.
