# Lectern and Written Book

ImmersiveMC supports showing the contents of a book placed in a lectern and the contents of a held book!

## Lectern

If a book is placed in a lectern, you're able to read its contents in-world! You can flip between pages by right-clicking the edges of the book out of VR, or by physically turning the page from one edge to the other in VR. The page you're on will sync between players, so feel free to read together if you want!

If the book has any clickable elements, you can right-click them out of VR or hover your hand over the text and press your break block button to click the text.

## Written Book

If you're in VR, you can also hold a book in your hand to read its contents. You flip pages and interact with interactable text the same way you would with a lectern.
