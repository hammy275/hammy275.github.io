# FAQ

## Tips, Tricks, and Controls

### Q: How do I access the bag?

A: See [Opening the Bag](/vr/bag#opening-the-bag). It is not the same as opening your inventory normally!

### Q: How do I see other items in the bag/chest/barrel/shulker box?

A: Simply press your break block button while pointing at the chest/barrel/shulker box, or press left click while pointing at nothing for the bag.

### Q: How do I access ImmersiveMC settings?

A: If you're not in VR, the easiest way to access ImmersiveMC's settings is to join a world, then click the settings key for ImmersiveMC on your keyboard. By default, this is the "," (comma) key.

If you're in VR, the easiest way to access ImmersiveMC's settings is to map the "ImmersiveMC Settings" button to your radial menu. You can add this button by going to Options -> VR Settings -> Radial Menu, then clicking the button you want to replace, then scrolling and clicking "ImmersiveMC Settings".  

### Q: Placing one item at a time is so slow! Can I place more than one item at a time?

A: Yes! If you hold the button used to break blocks or if you crouch while placing or taking items, you'll take as many items as possible, as if you were shift-clicking. Any hitboxes that require you to hold your break block button to interact with, such as the output of a crafting table, will only let you crouch to perform this behavior.

Furthermore, when placing items into some Immersives, you can drag between multiple slots to place items in them all at once! Hold your break block button while doing so to split the items evenly among those slots!

### Q: Can I change or disable the boxes that appear where I can place items?

A: Yes! Those are called item guides, and can be customized in ImmersiveMC's settings under "Customize Item Guides". You can adjust their size, transparency, color, and look! You can disable them entirely by changing the "Item Guide Mode" to "No Item Guides".

## Clients and Servers

### Q: What happens if someone without ImmersiveMC joins a server with ImmersiveMC?

A: Those without ImmersiveMC can join servers with ImmersiveMC! However, they won't be able to use any features included with ImmersiveMC.

### Q: Can I join a server without ImmersiveMC with ImmersiveMC?

A: Yes! However, you won't be able to use any ImmersiveMC features. It would be as if you never had ImmersiveMC installed in the first place.

### Q: Can I use ImmersiveMC on a server without ImmersiveMC installed? On Minecraft Realms?

A: No. The server must have ImmersiveMC installed.

### Q: I'm hosting a world via LAN or a world sharing mod. Can I disable an Immersive for myself while still letting others use it? How about disabling an Immersive for everyone?

A: Yes and yes!

If you want to disable an Immersive for yourself but allow others to use it, simply disable the Immersive in ImmersiveMC's settings.

If you want to disable an Immersive for everyone, open ImmersiveMC's settings, then click the button labeled "Currently Adjusting: Your Config". The button should change to mention you're now adjusting the "Server Config", meaning any changes you make will apply for everyone who joins you, including yourself! From here, simply disable the Immersives you don't want anyone to use, and they'll be disabled for everyone!

## Help/Troubleshooting

### Q: Help! My bag won't open!

A: If you haven't already, upgrade ImmersiveMC to the latest version and ensure you're using Vivecraft 1.3.3 or later (or MC VR API if you're using an older version of ImmersiveMC). From there, opening your bag should either work, or send a chat message stating why it didn't work.

### Q: Help! I can't sneak and right-click to place blocks sometimes!

A: This is an intended feature to allow users to access the UI for blocks that are supported by ImmersiveMC. You can disable this feature in ImmersiveMC's settings, by changing the option where "Crouching Bypasses Immersive" to another option.

### Q: Help! My game immediately crashes when I launch it!

A: Please ensure you have the Fabric versions of all of ImmersiveMC's requirements installed. Additionally, make sure you're downloading the mods for the correct Minecraft version.

### Q: Help! The textures for Immersives are all weird and glitchy!

A: Odds are, you may have OptiFine shaders on (even just the internal ones). You'll need to turn those off, or switch to another shaders mod, such as [Iris](https://modrinth.com/mod/iris) or [Oculus](https://modrinth.com/mod/oculus).

### Q: Some VR-only functionality isn't working!

A: The server may not have Vivecraft 1.3.3 or later installed, be sure to install it!
