# Shields

## How to Use It

VR players can block using shields without having to hold down the "use"/"right click" key! When using a shield like this, shields cover 60 degrees in each direction from the forward pointing direction of the shield. Additionally, shields have a hitbox, which can be used to deflect projectiles before they reach the player!

## In Comparison

In comparison to regular shields (or shields being used by non-VR users), using shields in this way have the following advantages and disadvantages:

Advantages:
- You can dual-wield shields, giving you more coverage than the one shield provided in Vanilla.
- VR users won't slow down while blocking with shields.

Disadvantages:
- VR users using 1 shield block less, only covering 60 degrees in each direction, rather than the 90 degrees that is provided to Vanilla players.


## A Note

VR users can choose to fallback to normal shield behavior by holding the "use"/"right click" key.
