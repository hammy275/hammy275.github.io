# Bottles, Buckets, and Liquids

You can perform plenty of interactions involving buckets and bottles.

- You can scoop any liquid into a bucket. Simply make a scooping motion with the bucket in the liquid. This also works at a cauldron!
- You can fill a bottle with water by making a scooping motion with the bottle in a source of water. This also works at a cauldron!
- You can dump the liquid in a bottle or bucket into a cauldron. Simply flip the bottle or bucket upside-down over the cauldron.
- You can perform other cauldron interactions, such as removing dye from leather armor. Simply dip the item in.
