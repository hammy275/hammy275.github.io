# Bag

## Opening the Bag

There are several ways to open the bag:

1. Reach behind your back with your secondary hand (the hand which would normally hold shields). This gesture can be customized in ImmersiveMC's settings under "Customize Bag".
2. Add the "Open/Close Bag" button to your Radial Menu. This can be done by going to Options -> VR Settings -> Radial Menu, then clicking the button you want to replace, then scrolling and clicking "Open/Close Bag".
3. Add it to your SteamVR Bindings under the "Modded" tab.

When you're done with the bag, you can follow the same steps used to open it to close it.

## Using the Bag

The bag represents your inventory, and also has a mini, 2x2 crafting table for crafting. You can interact with any slot you see by hovering over it, then pressing the trigger (or whatever button you use to break blocks). If you press the same button while not pointing at anything, you will change which row of your inventory is displayed at the top of the bag. While crafting, the item you're going to craft will appear above the table once you've put in the ingredients to make something, which can be grabbed the same way you place/take items.
