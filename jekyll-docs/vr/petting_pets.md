# Petting Pets

If you're in VR, you can move your hand slowly on any pets you have to pet them! By default, you can pet any animals you have tamed towards yourself or any horses, donkeys, mules, etc. that have been tamed by a player.

You can change the config option "Allow Petting Anything Living" (`can_pet_any_living` in server configs) to allow players to pet any living entity including pigs, parrots, players, pillagers, and more!
