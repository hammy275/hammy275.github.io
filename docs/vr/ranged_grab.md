# Ranged Grab

Whenever you point at an item while in VR using ImmersiveMC, it should give off blue particles. When it's doing so, if you hold down your trigger (or whatever button you use to break blocks) then flick your controller up while still holding the trigger, the item will fly towards you! This makes grabbing items at range a breeze!
