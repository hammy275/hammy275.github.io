# Cauldron

You can interact with a cauldron using hand motions! 

For buckets and glass bottles, simply make a scooping motion while holding a bucket to fill it from a cauldron, or dump the liquid into the cauldron to fill it!

For all other cauldron interactions, such as removing the dye from leather armor, simply dip the item into the cauldron.
