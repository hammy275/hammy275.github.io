# Jukebox

When you're holding a disc in your hand, you can place the disc into the slot of a jukebox, and the jukebox will accept the disc and play music! To get this disc out, you'll need to use whatever button you use to place blocks, and a jukebox will not accept a disc if there already is one inside.
