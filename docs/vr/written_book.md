# Written Book

You can hold a written book to read its contents! You can flip between pages by putting your other hand at the edge of a page, then moving your hand towards the center of the book, as if you were turning the page. It's easier if you grab the page by the corner when turning this way.

For books that can be interacted with, such as ones generated with commands, you can interact by hovering your other hand over the text you want to interact with, then pressing the button that you have mapped to breaking blocks. Note that this may not be the same hand you're using to hover over the text in the first place!
