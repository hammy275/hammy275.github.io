# Throwing

You can throw things! Simply hold the button you use to break blocks while holding something you can throw, then release it as you move your hand to throw the item! The item will go farther depending on how hard you throw and it will go the direction you move your hand!

The following items can be thrown:

- Bottle o' Enchanting
- Egg
- Ender Pearl
- Snowball
- Trident (throws where you point)
