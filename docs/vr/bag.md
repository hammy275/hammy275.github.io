# Bag

## Opening the Bag

There are three ways to open the bag:

1. Enable the "Reach Behind Bag" feature in ImmersiveMC's Settings, then reach behind your back in-game. Note that enabling this option disables a similar feature for switching between hotbar slots in Vivecraft.
2. Add the "Open/Close Bag" button to your Radial Menu. This can be done by going to Options -> VR Settings -> Radial Menu, then clicking the button you want to replace, then scrolling and clicking "Open/Close Bag".
3. Add it to your SteamVR Bindings under the "Modded" tab.

## Using the Bag

The bag represents your inventory, and also has a mini, 2x2 crafting table. You can interact with any slot you see by hovering over it, then pressing the trigger (or whatever button you use to break blocks). The bag is used to get stuff from your inventory or place things into it while the crafting table on the side can be used to craft things. The item you're going to craft will appear above the table once you've put in the ingredients to make something.

When you're done with the bag, you can follow the same steps used to open it to close it.
