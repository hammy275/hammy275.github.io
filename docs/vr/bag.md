# Bag

To use the bag, you'll first need to add "Open/Close Bag" to your radial menu, or configure it in your controls. You can add it to your controls by [Configuring Vivecraft Bindings](https://www.vivecraft.org/vivecraft-steamvr-input/), or you can add it to your Radial Menu by pausing, then going to Options --> VR Settings --> Radial Menu, and adding it there.

By pressing whatever key you have mapped to "Open/Close Bag" (or by clicking the button in the radial menu), you'll open your bag! This bag represents your inventory, and also has a mini, 2x2 crafting table. You can interact with any slot you see by hovering over it, then pressing the trigger (or whatever button you use to break blocks). The bag is used to get stuff from your inventory or place things into it while the crafting table on the side can be used to craft things. The item you're going to craft will appear above the table once you've put in the ingredients to make something.

When you're done with the bag, you can follow the same steps used to open it to close it.
