# Barrel

The barrel immersive works similarly to the [Shulker Box's immersive](https://github.com/hammy3502/immersive-mc/wiki/Shulker-Box-Immersive)! Right click on the barrel to open it, place in your items, punch it to change to the different rows of the barrel, then right click again to close it!

For VR users, you can also open the barrel by pulling back (towards yourself) on the handle of the barrel.
