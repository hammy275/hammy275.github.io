# Shulker Box

You can right click Shulker Boxes to open them without a GUI, and right click again to close them. They work similarly to chests, right clicking an item will stack the item or swap it with the one in your hand. Right clicking an empty space will put the item you're holding into that slot. Additionally, you can punch to swap to the next row of slots, allowing you to interact with all 3 rows of your Shulker Boxes!
