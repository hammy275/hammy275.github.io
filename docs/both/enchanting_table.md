# Enchanting Table

To use the enchanting table immersive:

1. Place your item by right clicking or physically placing your hand with the item into the blue box above an enchanting table

2. If you're out of VR, look at the three hovering items. If you're in VR, point at the three hovering items. Each will show the amount of levels you need (the number not in parentheses), the amount of levels and lapis lazuli you'll use (the number in parentheses), and an enchantment you'll get.

3. Right click/grab the item you want. If you have enough levels and lapis lazuli, they will be removed from your inventory and XP, and you'll have the item.
