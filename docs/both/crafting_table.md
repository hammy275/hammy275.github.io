# Crafting Table

## Non-VR

Using the crafting table immersive is simple! Simply right click on the blue boxes above the crafting table, placing items in the same way you would your 3x3 crafting grid. From there, you can right click the floating item that appears above the crafting table to retrieve whatever you wanted to craft!

## VR

Using the crafting table immersive is simple! Simply place the items into the blue boxes by placing your hand in said blue boxes. Place the items in the same pattern you would for the standard crafting grid. From there, move your hand into the item that appears above the crafting table, and press the trigger (or whatever button you have mapped to "attack") to craft that item!
