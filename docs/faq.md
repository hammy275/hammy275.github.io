# FAQ

## Tips, Tricks, and Controls


### Q: How do I access ImmersiveMC settings?

A: The easiest way to access ImmersiveMC's settings is to join a world, then click the settings key for ImmersiveMC on your keyboard. By default, this is the "," (comma) key.

### Q: Placing one item at a time is so slow! Can I place more than one item at a time?

A: Yes! You can change the Placement Mode in ImmersiveMC's settings to change the amount of items you place when interacting with immersives. Additionally, holding left-click (or whatever button you have mapped to block breaking) while placing items will place the entire stack!


## Clients and Servers

### Q: What happens if someone without ImmersiveMC joins a server with ImmersiveMC?

A: Those without ImmersiveMC can join servers with ImmersiveMC! However, they won't be able to use any features included with ImmersiveMC.

### Q: Can I join a server without ImmersiveMC with ImmersiveMC?

A: Yes! However, you won't be able to use any ImmersiveMC features. It would be as if you never had ImmersiveMC installed in the first place.

### Q: Can I use ImmersiveMC on a server without ImmersiveMC installed? On Minecraft Realms?

A: No. The server must have ImmersiveMC installed.


## Help/Troubleshooting

### Q: Help! My bag won't open!

A: If you haven't already, upgrade ImmersiveMC and mc-vr-api to the latest version that supports your version of Minecraft. From there, opening your bag should either work, or send a chat message stating why it didn't work.

### Q: Help! I'm using Questcraft and my game immediately crashes!

A: Please ensure you have the Fabric versions of all of ImmersiveMC's requirements installed. Additionally, make sure you're downloading the mods for the correct Minecraft version.

### Q: Help! The textures for Immersives are all weird and glitchy!

A: Odds are, you may have Optifine shaders on (even just the internal ones). You'll need to turn those off, or switch to another shaders mod, such as [Iris](https://modrinth.com/mod/iris) or [Oculus](https://modrinth.com/mod/oculus).

### Q: I can't use any of the VR interactions for ImmersiveMC, and I need to "right click" in VR to place things!

A: Either you, the server, or both, don't have the required `mc-vr-api` mod installed! You can download it [here](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/mc-vr-api), making sure to install it on the server and for yourself.
