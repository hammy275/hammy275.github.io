# Help/Troubleshooting

### Q: Help! I'm using Questcraft and my game immediately crashes!

A: Please ensure you have the Fabric versions of all of ImmersiveMC's requirements installed. Additionally, make sure you're downloading the mods for the correct Minecraft version.

### Q: Help! The textures for Immersives are all weird and glitchy!

A: Odds are, you may have shaders on (even just the internal ones from Optifine). You'll need to turn those off, sadly.

### Q: I can't use any of the VR interactions for ImmersiveMC, and I need to "right click" in VR to place things!

A: Either you, the server, or both, don't have the required `mc-vr-api` mod installed! You can download it [here](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/mc-vr-api), making sure to install it on the server and for yourself.
