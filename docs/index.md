# ImmersiveMC Wiki

Welcome to the wiki for ImmersiveMC!

This wiki has guides, tutorials, FAQs, and more! Before you get started, you'll want to familiarize yourself with what we call an **Immersive**. Long story short, an Immersive is the single block/entity/whatever else that ImmersiveMC adds to make something more immersive. For example, the support for the crafting table by ImmerisveMC is called the **Crafting Table Immersive**.

That aside, take a look on the right hand side, and pick an entry to start browsing!
